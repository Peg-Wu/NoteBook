matter to us his grey eyes shone and',\n 'twinkled and his usually pale face was flushed and animated the',\n 'fire burned brightly and the soft radiance of the incandescent',\n 'lights in the lilies of silver caught the bubbles that flashed and',\n 'passed in our glasses our chairs being his patents embraced and',\n 'caressed us rather than submitted to be sat upon and there was that',\n 'luxurious after dinner atmosphere when thought roams gracefully',\n 'free of the trammels of precision and he put it to us in this',\n 'way marking the points with a lean forefinger as we sat and lazily',\n 'admired his earnestness over this new paradox as we thought it',\n 'and his fecundity',\n '',\n 'you must follow me carefully i shall have to controvert one or two',\n 'ideas that are almost universally accepted the geometry for',\n 'instance they taught you at school is founded on a misconception',\n '',\n 'is not that rather a large thing to expect us to begin upon',\n 'said filby an argumentative person with red hair',\n '',\n 'i do not mean to ask you to accept anything without reasonable',\n 'ground for it you will soon admit as much as i need from you you',\n 'know of course that a mathematical line a line of thickness nil',\n 'has no real existence they taught you that neither has a',\n 'mathematical plane these things are mere abstractions',\n '',\n 'that is all right said the psychologist',\n '',\n 'nor having only length breadth and thickness can a cube have a',\n 'real existence',\n '',\n 'there i object said filby of course a solid body may exist all',\n 'real things',\n '',\n 'so most people think but wait a moment can an instantaneous',\n 'cube exist',\n '',\n 'don t follow you said filby',\n '',\n 'can a cube that does not last for any time at all have a real',\n 'existence',\n '',\n 'filby became pensive clearly the time traveller proceeded any',\n 'real body must have extension in four directions it must have',\n 'length breadth thickness and duration but through a natural',\n 'infirmity of the flesh which i will explain to you in a moment we',\n 'incline to overlook this fact there are really four dimensions',\n 'three which we call the three planes of space and a fourth time',\n 'there is however a tendency to draw an unreal distinction between',\n 'the former three dimensions and the latter because it happens that',\n 'our consciousness moves intermittently in one direction along the',\n 'latter from the beginning to the end of our lives',\n '',\n 'that said a very young man making spasmodic efforts to relight',\n 'his cigar over the lamp that very clear indeed',\n '',\n 'now it is very remarkable that this is so extensively overlooked',\n 'continued the time traveller with a slight accession of',\n 'cheerfulness really this is what is meant by the fourth dimension',\n 'though some people who talk about the fourth dimension do not know',\n 'they mean it it is only another way of looking at time there is',\n 'no difference between time and any of the three dimensions of space',\n 'except that our consciousness moves along it but some foolish',\n 'people have got hold of the wrong side of that idea you have all',\n 'heard what they have to say about this fourth dimension',\n '',\n 'i have not said the provincial mayor',\n '',\n 'it is simply this that space as our mathematicians have it is',\n 'spoken of as having three dimensions which one may call length',\n 'breadth and thickness and is always definable by reference to',\n 'three planes each at right angles to the others but some',\n 'philosophical people have been asking why three dimensions',\n 'particularly why not another direction at right angles to the other',\n 'three and have even tried to construct a four dimension geometry',\n 'professor simon newcomb was expounding this to the new york',\n 'mathematical society only a month or so ago you know how on a flat',\n 'surface which has only two dimensions we can represent a figure of',\n 'a three dimensional solid and similarly they think that by models',\n 'of three dimensions they could represent one of four if they could',\n 'master the perspective of the thing see',\n '',\n 'i think so murmured the provincial mayor and knitting his',\n 'brows he lapsed into an introspective state his lips moving as one',\n 'who repeats mystic words yes i think i see it now he said after',\n 'some time brightening in a quite transitory manner',\n '',\n 'well i do not mind telling you i have been at work upon this',\n 'geometry of four dimensions for some time some of my results',\n 'are curious for instance here is a portrait of a man at eight',\n 'years old another at fifteen another at seventeen another at',\n 'twenty three and so on all these are evidently sections as it',\n 'were three dimensional representations of his four dimensioned',\n 'being which is a fixed and unalterable thing',\n '',\n 'scientific people proceeded the time traveller after the pause',\n 'required for the proper assimilation of this know very well that',\n 'time is only a kind of space here is a popular scientific diagram',\n 'a weather record this line i trace with my finger shows the',\n 'movement of the barometer yesterday it was so high yesterday night',\n 'it fell then this morning it rose again and so gently upward to',\n 'here surely the mercury did not trace this line in any of the',\n 'dimensions of space generally recognized but certainly it traced',\n 'such a line and that line therefore we must conclude was along',\n 'the time dimension',\n '',\n 'but said the medical man staring hard at a coal in the fire if',\n 'time is really only a fourth dimension of space why is it and why',\n 'has it always been regarded as something different and why cannot',\n 'we move in time as we move about in the other dimensions of space',\n '',\n 'the time traveller smiled are you sure we can move freely in',\n 'space right and left we can go backward and forward freely enough',\n 'and men always have done so i admit we move freely in two',\n 'dimensions but how about up and down gravitation limits us there',\n '',\n 'not exactly said the medical man there are balloons',\n '',\n 'but before the balloons save for spasmodic jumping and the',\n 'inequalities of the surface man had no freedom of vertical',\n 'movement',\n '',\n 'still they could move a little up and down said the medical man',\n '',\n 'easier far easier down than up',\n '',\n 'and you cannot move at all in time you cannot get away from the',\n 'present moment',\n '',\n 'my dear sir that is just where you are wrong that is just where',\n 'the whole world has gone wrong we are always getting away from the',\n 'present moment our mental existences which are immaterial and have',\n 'no dimensions are passing along the time dimension with a uniform',\n 'velocity from the cradle to the grave just as we should travel down',\n 'if we began our existence fifty miles above the earth s surface',\n '',\n 'but the great difficulty is this interrupted the psychologist',\n 'you can move about in all directions of space but you cannot',\n 'move about in time',\n '',\n 'that is the germ of my great discovery but you are wrong to say',\n 'that we cannot move about in time for instance if i am recalling',\n 'an incident very vividly i go back to the instant of its occurrence',\n 'i become absent minded as you say i jump back for a moment of',\n 'course we have no means of staying back for any length of time any',\n 'more than a savage or an animal has of staying six feet above the',\n 'ground but a civilized man is better off than the savage in this',\n 'respect he can go up against gravitation in a balloon and why',\n 'should he not hope that ultimately he may be able to stop or',\n 'accelerate his drift along the time dimension or even turn about',\n 'and travel the other way',\n '',\n 'oh this began filby is all',\n '',\n 'why not said the time traveller',\n '',\n 'it s against reason said filby',\n '',\n 'what reason said the time traveller',\n '',\n 'you can show black is white by argument said filby but you will',\n 'never convince me',\n '',\n 'possibly not said the time traveller but now you begin to see',\n 'the object of my investigations into the geometry of four',\n 'dimensions long ago i had a vague inkling of a machine',\n '',\n 'to travel through time exclaimed the very young man',\n '',\n 'that shall travel indifferently in any direction of space and time',\n 'as the driver determines',\n '',\n 'filby contented himself with laughter',\n '',\n 'but i have experimental verification said the time traveller',\n '',\n 'it would be remarkably convenient for the historian the',\n 'psychologist suggested one might travel back and verify the',\n 'accepted account of the battle of hastings for instance',\n '',\n 'don t you think you would attract attention said the medical man',\n 'our ancestors had no great tolerance for anachronisms',\n '',\n 'one might get one s greek from the very lips of homer and plato',\n 'the very young man thought',\n '',\n 'in which case they would certainly plough you for the little go',\n 'the german scholars have improved greek so much',\n '',\n 'then there is the future said the very young man just think',\n 'one might invest all one s money leave it to accumulate at',\n 'interest and hurry on ahead',\n '',\n 'to discover a society said i erected on a strictly communistic',\n 'basis',\n '',\n 'of all the wild extravagant theories began the psychologist',\n '',\n 'yes so it seemed to me and so i never talked of it until',\n '',\n 'experimental verification cried i you are going to verify',\n 'that',\n '',\n 'the experiment cried filby who was getting brain weary',\n '',\n 'let s see your experiment anyhow said the psychologist though',\n 'it s all humbug you know',\n '',\n 'the time traveller smiled round at us then still smiling faintly',\n 'and with his hands deep in his trousers pockets he walked slowly',\n 'out of the room and we heard his slippers shuffling down the long',\n 'passage to his laboratory',\n '',\n 'the psychologist looked at us i wonder what he s got',\n '',\n 'some sleight of hand trick or other said the medical man and',\n 'filby tried to tell us about a conjurer he had seen at burslem but',\n 'before he had finished his preface the time traveller came back and',\n 'filby s anecdote collapsed',\n '',\n 'the thing the time traveller held in his hand was a glittering',\n 'metallic framework scarcely larger than a small clock and very',\n 'delicately made there was ivory in it and some transparent',\n 'crystalline substance and now i must be explicit for this that',\n 'follows unless his explanation is to be accepted is an absolutely',\n 'unaccountable thing he took one of the small octagonal tables that',\n 'were scattered about the room and set it in front of the fire with',\n 'two legs on the hearthrug on this table he placed the mechanism',\n 'then he drew up a chair and sat down the only other object on the',\n 'table was a small shaded lamp the bright light of which fell upon',\n 'the model there were also perhaps a dozen candles about two in',\n 'brass candlesticks upon the mantel and several in sconces so that',\n 'the room was brilliantly illuminated i sat in a low arm chair',\n 'nearest the fire and i drew this forward so as to be almost between',\n 'the time traveller and the fireplace filby sat behind him looking',\n 'over his shoulder the medical man and the provincial mayor watched',\n 'him in profile from the right the psychologist from the left the',\n 'very young man stood behind the psychologist we were all on the',\n 'alert it appears incredible to me that any kind of trick however',\n 'subtly conceived and however adroitly done could have been played',\n 'upon us under these conditions',\n '',\n 'the time traveller looked at us and then at the mechanism well',\n 'said the psychologist',\n '',\n 'this little affair said the time traveller resting his elbows',\n 'upon the table and pressing his hands together above the apparatus',\n 'is only a model it is my plan for a machine to travel through',\n 'time you will notice that it looks singularly askew and that there',\n 'is an odd twinkling appearance about this bar as though it was in',\n 'some way unreal he pointed to the part with his finger also',\n 'here is one little white lever and here is another',\n '',\n 'the medical man got up out of his chair and peered into the thing',\n 'it s beautifully made he said',\n '',\n 'it took two years to make retorted the time traveller then when',\n 'we had all imitated the action of the medical man he said now i',\n 'want you clearly to understand that this lever being pressed over',\n 'sends the machine gliding into the future and this other reverses',\n 'the motion this saddle represents the seat of a time traveller',\n 'presently i am going to press the lever and off the machine will',\n 'go it will vanish pass into future time and disappear have a',\n 'good look at the thing look at the table too and satisfy',\n 'yourselves there is no trickery i don t want to waste this model',\n 'and then be told i m a quack',\n '',\n 'there was a minute s pause perhaps the psychologist seemed about to',\n 'speak to me but changed his mind then the time traveller put forth',\n 'his finger towards the lever no he said suddenly lend me your',\n 'hand and turning to the psychologist he took that individual s',\n 'hand in his own and told him to put out his forefinger so that it',\n 'was the psychologist himself who sent forth the model time machine',\n 'on its interminable voyage we all saw the lever turn i am',\n 'absolutely certain there was no trickery there was a breath of',\n 'wind and the lamp flame jumped one of the candles on the mantel',\n 'was blown out and the little machine suddenly swung round became',\n 'indistinct was seen as a ghost for a second perhaps as an eddy of',\n 'faintly glittering brass and ivory and it was gone vanished save',\n 'for the lamp the table was bare',\n '',\n 'everyone was silent for a minute then filby said he was damned',\n '',\n 'the psychologist recovered from his stupor and suddenly looked',\n 'under the table at that the time traveller laughed cheerfully',\n 'well he said with a reminiscence of the psychologist then',\n 'getting up he went to the tobacco jar on the mantel and with his',\n 'back to us began to fill his pipe',\n '',\n 'we stared at each other look here said the medical man are you',\n 'in earnest about this do you seriously believe that that machine',\n 'has travelled into time',\n '',\n 'certainly said the time traveller stooping to light a spill at',\n 'the fire then he turned lighting his pipe to look at the',\n 'psychologist s face the psychologist to show that he was not',\n 'unhinged helped himself to a cigar and tried to light it uncut',\n 'what is more i have a big machine nearly finished in there he',\n 'indicated the laboratory and when that is put together i mean to',\n 'have a journey on my own account',\n '',\n 'you mean to say that that machine has travelled into the future',\n 'said filby',\n '',\n 'into the future or the past i don t for certain know which',\n '',\n 'after an interval the psychologist had an inspiration it must have',\n 'gone into the past if it has gone anywhere he said',\n '',\n 'why said the time traveller',\n '',\n 'because i presume that it has not moved in space and if it',\n 'travelled into the future it would still be here all this time',\n 'since it must have travelled through this time',\n '',\n 'but i said if it travelled into the past it would have been',\n 'visible when we came first into this room and last thursday when we',\n 'were here and the thursday before that and so forth',\n '',\n 'serious objections remarked the provincial mayor with an air of',\n 'impartiality turning towards the time traveller',\n '',\n 'not a bit said the time traveller and to the psychologist you',\n 'think you can explain that it s presentation below the threshold',\n 'you know diluted presentation',\n '',\n 'of course said the psychologist and reassured us that s a',\n 'simple point of psychology i should have thought of it it s plain',\n 'enough and helps the paradox delightfully we cannot see it nor',\n 'can we appreciate this machine any more than we can the spoke of',\n 'a wheel spinning or a bullet flying through the air if it is',\n 'travelling through time fifty times or a hundred times faster than',\n 'we are if it gets through a minute while we get through a second',\n 'the impression it creates will of course be only one fiftieth or',\n 'one hundredth of what it would make if it were not travelling in',\n 'time that s plain enough he passed his hand through the space in',\n 'which the machine had been you see he said laughing',\n '',\n 'we sat and stared at the vacant table for a minute or so then the',\n 'time traveller asked us what we thought of it all',\n '',\n 'it sounds plausible enough to night said the medical man but',\n 'wait until to morrow wait for the common sense of the morning',\n '',\n 'would you like to see the time machine itself asked the time',\n 'traveller and therewith taking the lamp in his hand he led the',\n 'way down the long draughty corridor to his laboratory i remember',\n 'vividly the flickering light his queer broad head in silhouette',\n 'the dance of the shadows how we all followed him puzzled but',\n 'incredulous and how there in the laboratory we beheld a larger',\n 'edition of the little mechanism which we had seen vanish from before',\n 'our eyes parts were of nickel parts of ivory parts had certainly',\n 'been filed or sawn out of rock crystal the thing was generally',\n 'complete but the twisted crystalline bars lay unfinished upon the',\n 'bench beside some sheets of drawings and i took one up for a better',\n 'look at it quartz it seemed to be',\n '',\n 'look here said the medical man are you perfectly serious',\n 'or is this a trick like that ghost you showed us last christmas',\n '',\n 'upon that machine said the time traveller holding the lamp',\n 'aloft i intend to explore time is that plain i was never more',\n 'serious in my life',\n '',\n 'none of us quite knew how to take it',\n '',\n 'i caught filby s eye over the shoulder of the medical man and he',\n 'winked at me solemnly',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n 'ii',\n '',\n '',\n 'i think that at that time none of us quite believed in the time',\n 'machine the fact is the time traveller was one of those men who',\n 'are too clever to be believed you never felt that you saw all round',\n 'him you always suspected some subtle reserve some ingenuity in',\n 'ambush behind his lucid frankness had filby shown the model and',\n 'explained the matter in the time traveller s words we should have',\n 'shown him far less scepticism for we should have perceived his',\n 'motives a pork butcher could understand filby but the time',\n 'traveller had more than a touch of whim among his elements and we',\n 'distrusted him things that would have made the frame of a less',\n 'clever man seemed tricks in his hands it is a mistake to do things',\n 'too easily the serious people who took him seriously never felt',\n 'quite sure of his deportment they were somehow aware that trusting',\n 'their reputations for judgment with him was like furnishing a',\n 'nursery with egg shell china so i don t think any of us said very',\n 'much about time travelling in the interval between that thursday and',\n 'the next though its odd potentialities ran no doubt in most of',\n 'our minds its plausibility that is its practical incredibleness',\n 'the curious possibilities of anachronism and of utter confusion it',\n 'suggested for my own part i was particularly preoccupied with the',\n 'trick of the model that i remember discussing with the medical man',\n 'whom i met on friday at the linnaean he said he had seen a similar',\n 'thing at tubingen and laid considerable stress on the blowing out',\n 'of the candle but how the trick was done he could not explain',\n '',\n 'the next thursday i went again to richmond i suppose i was one of',\n 'the time traveller s most constant guests and arriving late found',\n 'four or five men already assembled in his drawing room the medical',\n 'man was standing before the fire with a sheet of paper in one hand',\n 'and his watch in the other i looked round for the time traveller',\n 'and it s half past seven now said the medical man i suppose',\n 'we d better have dinner',\n '',\n 'where s said i naming our host',\n '',\n 'you ve just come it s rather odd he s unavoidably detained he',\n 'asks me in this note to lead off with dinner at seven if he s not',\n 'back says he ll explain when he comes',\n '',\n 'it seems a pity to let the dinner spoil said the editor of a',\n 'well known daily paper and thereupon the doctor rang the bell',\n '',\n 'the psychologist was the only person besides the doctor and myself',\n 'who had attended the previous dinner the other men were blank the',\n 'editor aforementioned a certain journalist and another a quiet',\n 'shy man with a beard whom i didn t know and who as far as my',\n 'observation went never opened his mouth all the evening there was',\n 'some speculation at the dinner table about the time traveller s',\n 'absence and i suggested time travelling in a half jocular spirit',\n 'the editor wanted that explained to him and the psychologist',\n 'volunteered a wooden account of the ingenious paradox and trick we',\n 'had witnessed that day week he was in the midst of his exposition',\n 'when the door from the corridor opened slowly and without noise i',\n 'was facing the door and saw it first hallo i said at last',\n 'and the door opened wider and the time traveller stood before us',\n 'i gave a cry of surprise good heavens man what s the matter',\n 'cried the medical man who saw him next and the whole tableful',\n 'turned towards the door',\n '',\n 'he was in an amazing plight his coat was dusty and dirty and',\n 'smeared with green down the sleeves his hair disordered and as it',\n 'seemed to me greyer either with dust and dirt or because its colour',\n 'had actually faded his face was ghastly pale his chin had a brown',\n 'cut on it a cut half healed his expression was haggard and drawn',\n 'as by intense suffering for a moment he hesitated in the doorway',\n 'as if he had been dazzled by the light then he came into the room',\n 'he walked with just such a limp as i have seen in footsore tramps',\n 'we stared at him in silence expecting him to speak',\n '',\n 'he said not a word but came painfully to the table and made a',\n 'motion towards the wine the editor filled a glass of champagne and',\n 'pushed it towards him he drained it and it seemed to do him good',\n 'for he looked round the table and the ghost of his old smile',\n 'flickered across his face what on earth have you been up to man',\n 'said the doctor the time traveller did not seem to hear don t let',\n 'me disturb you he said with a certain faltering articulation',\n 'i m all right he stopped held out his glass for more and took',\n 'it off at a draught that s good he said his eyes grew brighter',\n 'and a faint colour came into his cheeks his glance flickered over',\n 'our faces with a certain dull approval and then went round the warm',\n 'and comfortable room then he spoke again still as it were feeling',\n 'his way among his words i m going to wash and dress and then i ll',\n 'come down and explain things save me some of that mutton i m',\n 'starving for a bit of meat',\n '',\n 'he looked across at the editor who was a rare visitor and hoped he',\n 'was all right the editor began a question tell you presently',\n 'said the time traveller i m funny be all right in a minute',\n '',\n 'he put down his glass and walked towards the staircase door again',\n 'i remarked his lameness and the soft padding sound of his footfall',\n 'and standing up in my place i saw his feet as he went out he had',\n 'nothing on them but a pair of tattered blood stained socks then the',\n 'door closed upon him i had half a mind to follow till i remembered',\n 'how he detested any fuss about himself for a minute perhaps my',\n 'mind was wool gathering then remarkable behaviour of an eminent',\n 'scientist i heard the editor say thinking after his wont in',\n 'headlines and this brought my attention back to the bright',\n 'dinner table',\n '',\n 'what s the game said the journalist has he been doing the',\n 'amateur cadger i don t follow i met the eye of the psychologist',\n 'and read my own interpretation in his face i thought of the time',\n 'traveller limping painfully upstairs i don t think any one else had',\n 'noticed his lameness',\n '',\n 'the first to recover completely from this surprise was the medical',\n 'man who rang the bell the time traveller hated to have servants',\n 'waiting at dinner for a hot plate at that the editor turned to his',\n 'knife and fork with a grunt and the silent man followed suit the',\n 'dinner was resumed conversation was exclamatory for a little while',\n 'with gaps of wonderment and then the editor got fervent in his',\n 'curiosity does our friend eke out his modest income with a',\n 'crossing or has he his nebuchadnezzar phases he inquired i feel',\n 'assured it s this business of the time machine i said and took up',\n 'the psychologist s account of our previous meeting the new guests',\n 'were frankly incredulous the editor raised objections what was',\n 'this time travelling a man couldn t cover himself with dust by',\n 'rolling in a paradox could he and then as the idea came home to',\n 'him he resorted to caricature hadn t they any clothes brushes in',\n 'the future the journalist too would not believe at any price and',\n 'joined the editor in the easy work of heaping ridicule on the whole',\n 'thing they were both the new kind of journalist very joyous',\n 'irreverent young men our special correspondent in the day',\n 'after to morrow reports the journalist was saying or rather',\n 'shouting when the time traveller came back he was dressed in',\n 'ordinary evening clothes and nothing save his haggard look remained',\n 'of the change that had startled me',\n '',\n 'i say said the editor hilariously these chaps here say you have',\n 'been travelling into the middle of next week tell us all about',\n 'little rosebery will you what will you take for the lot',\n '',\n 'the time traveller came to the place reserved for him without a',\n 'word he smiled quietly in his old way where s my mutton he',\n 'said what a treat it is to stick a fork into meat again',\n '',\n 'story cried the editor',\n '',\n 'story be damned said the time traveller i want something to',\n 'eat i won t say a word until i get some peptone into my arteries',\n 'thanks and the salt',\n '',\n 'one word said i have you been time travelling',\n '',\n 'yes said the time traveller with his mouth full nodding his',\n 'head',\n '',\n 'i d give a shilling a line for a verbatim note said the editor',\n 'the time traveller pushed his glass towards the silent man and rang',\n 'it with his fingernail at which the silent man who had been',\n 'staring at his face started convulsively and poured him wine',\n 'the rest of the dinner was uncomfortable for my own part sudden',\n 'questions kept on rising to my lips and i dare say it was the same',\n 'with the others the journalist tried to relieve the tension by',\n 'telling anecdotes of hettie potter the time traveller devoted his',\n 'attention to his dinner and displayed the appetite of a tramp',\n 'the medical man smoked a cigarette and watched the time traveller',\n 'through his eyelashes the silent man seemed even more clumsy than',\n 'usual and drank champagne with regularity and determination out of',\n 'sheer nervousness at last the time traveller pushed his plate away',\n 'and looked round us i suppose i must apologize he said i was',\n 'simply starving i ve had a most amazing time he reached out his',\n 'hand for a cigar and cut the end but come into the smoking room',\n 'it s too long a story to tell over greasy plates and ringing the',\n 'bell in passing he led the way into the adjoining room',\n '',\n 'you have told blank and dash and chose about the machine he',\n 'said to me leaning back in his easy chair and naming the three new',\n 'guests',\n '',\n 'but the thing s a mere paradox said the editor',\n '',\n 'i can t argue to night i don t mind telling you the story but',\n 'i can t argue i will he went on tell you the story of what',\n 'has happened to me if you like but you must refrain from',\n 'interruptions i want to tell it badly most of it will sound like',\n 'lying so be it it s true every word of it all the same i was in',\n 'my laboratory at four o clock and since then i ve lived eight',\n 'days such days as no human being ever lived before i m nearly',\n 'worn out but i shan t sleep till i ve told this thing over to you',\n 'then i shall go to bed but no interruptions is it agreed',\n '',\n 'agreed said the editor and the rest of us echoed agreed and',\n 'with that the time traveller began his story as i have set it forth',\n 'he sat back in his chair at first and spoke like a weary man',\n 'afterwards he got more animated in writing it down i feel with only',\n 'too much keenness the inadequacy of pen and ink and above all my',\n 'own inadequacy to express its quality you read i will suppose',\n 'attentively enough but you cannot see the speaker s white',\n

fair and pass like dreams',\n 'the whole surface of the earth seemed changed melting and flowing',\n 'under my eyes the little hands upon the dials that registered my',\n 'speed raced round faster and faster presently i noted that the sun',\n 'belt swayed up and down from solstice to solstice in a minute or',\n 'less and that consequently my pace was over a year a minute and',\n 'minute by minute the white snow flashed across the world and',\n 'vanished and was followed by the bright brief green of spring',\n '',\n 'the unpleasant sensations of the start were less poignant now they',\n 'merged at last into a kind of hysterical exhilaration i remarked',\n 'indeed a clumsy swaying of the machine for which i was unable to',\n 'account but my mind was too confused to attend to it so with a',\n 'kind of madness growing upon me i flung myself into futurity at',\n 'first i scarce thought of stopping scarce thought of anything but',\n 'these new sensations but presently a fresh series of impressions',\n 'grew up in my mind a certain curiosity and therewith a certain',\n 'dread until at last they took complete possession of me what',\n 'strange developments of humanity what wonderful advances upon our',\n 'rudimentary civilization i thought might not appear when i came to',\n 'look nearly into the dim elusive world that raced and fluctuated',\n 'before my eyes i saw great and splendid architecture rising about',\n 'me more massive than any buildings of our own time and yet as it',\n 'seemed built of glimmer and mist i saw a richer green flow up the',\n 'hill side and

risk lay in the possibility of my finding some',\n 'substance in the space which i or the machine occupied so long',\n 'as i travelled at a high velocity through time this scarcely',\n 'mattered i was so to speak attenuated was slipping like a vapour',\n 'through the interstices of intervening substances but to come to',\n 'a stop involved the jamming of myself molecule by molecule into',\n 'whatever lay in my way meant bringing my atoms into such intimate',\n 'contact with those of the obstacle that a profound chemical',\n 'reaction possibly a far reaching explosion would result and blow',\n 'myself and my apparatus out of all possible dimensions into the',\n 'unknown this possibility had occurred to me again and again while i',\n 'was making the machine but then i had cheerfully accepted it as an',\n 'unavoidable risk one of the risks a man has got to take now the',\n 'risk was inevitable i no longer saw it in the same cheerful light',\n 'the fact is that insensibly the absolute strangeness of everything',\n 'the sickly jarring and swaying of the machine above all the',\n 'feeling of prolonged falling had absolutely upset my nerve i told',\n 'myself that i could never stop and with a gust of petulance i',\n 'resolved to stop forthwith like an impatient fool i lugged over',\n 'the lever and incontinently the thing went reeling over and i was',\n 'flung headlong through the air',\n '',\n 'there was the sound of a clap of thunder in my ears i may have',\n 'been stunned for a moment a pitiless hail was hissing round me',\n 'and i was sitting on soft turf in front of the overset machine',\n 'everything still seemed grey but presently i remarked that the',\n 'confusion in my ears was gone i looked round me i was on what',\n 'seemed to be a little lawn in a garden surrounded by rhododendron',\n 'bushes and i noticed that their mauve and purple blossoms were',\n 'dropping in a shower under the beating of the hail stones the',\n 'rebounding dancing hail hung in a cloud over the machine and drove',\n 'along the ground like smoke in a moment i was wet to the skin',\n 'fine hospitality said i to a man who has travelled innumerable',\n 'years to see you',\n '',\n 'presently i thought what a fool i was to get wet i stood up and',\n 'looked round me a colossal figure carved apparently in some white',\n 'stone loomed indistinctly beyond the rhododendrons through the hazy',\n 'downpour but all else of the world was invisible',\n '',\n 'my sensations would be hard to describe as the columns of hail',\n 'grew thinner i saw the white figure more distinctly it was very',\n 'large for a silver birch tree touched its shoulder it was of white',\n 'marble in shape something like a winged sphinx but the wings',\n 'instead of being carried vertically at the sides were spread so',\n 'that it seemed to hover the pedestal it appeared to me was of',\n 'bronze and was thick with verdigris it chanced that the face was',\n 'towards me the sightless eyes seemed to watch me there was the',\n 'faint shadow of a smile on the lips it was greatly weather worn',\n 'and that imparted an unpleasant suggestion of disease i stood',\n 'looking at it for a little space half a minute perhaps or half an',\n 'hour it seemed to advance and to recede as the hail drove before it',\n 'denser or thinner at last i tore my eyes from it for a moment and',\n 'saw that the hail curtain had worn threadbare and that the sky was',\n 'lightening with the promise of the sun',\n '',\n 'i looked up again at the crouching white shape and the full',\n 'temerity of my voyage came suddenly upon me what might appear when',\n 'that hazy curtain was altogether withdrawn what might not have',\n 'happened to men what if cruelty had grown into a common passion',\n 'what if in this interval the race had lost its manliness and had',\n 'developed into something inhuman unsympathetic and overwhelmingly',\n 'powerful i might seem some old world savage animal only the more',\n 'dreadful and disgusting for our common likeness a foul creature to',\n 'be incontinently slain',\n '',\n 'already i saw other vast shapes huge buildings with intricate',\n 'parapets and tall columns with a wooded hill side dimly creeping',\n 'in upon me through the lessening storm i was seized with a panic',\n 'fear i turned frantically to the time machine and strove hard to',\n 'readjust it as i did so the shafts of the sun smote through the',\n 'thunderstorm the grey downpour was swept aside and vanished like',\n 'the trailing garments of a ghost above me in the intense blue',\n 'of the summer sky some faint brown shreds of cloud whirled into',\n 'nothingness the great buildings about me stood out clear and',\n 'distinct shining with the wet of the thunderstorm and picked out',\n 'in white by the unmelted hailstones piled along their courses i',\n 'felt naked in a strange world i felt as perhaps a bird may feel in',\n 'the clear air knowing the hawk wings above and will swoop my fear',\n 'grew to frenzy i took a breathing space set my teeth and again',\n 'grappled fiercely wrist and knee with the machine it gave under',\n 'my desperate onset and turned over it struck my chin violently one',\n 'hand on the saddle the other on the lever i stood panting heavily',\n 'in attitude to mount again',\n '',\n 'but with this recovery of a prompt retreat my courage recovered i',\n 'looked more curiously and less fearfully at this world of the remote',\n 'future in a circular opening high up in the wall of the nearer',\n 'house i saw a group of figures clad in rich soft robes they had',\n 'seen me and their faces were directed towards me',\n '',\n 'then i heard voices approaching me coming through the bushes by',\n 'the white sphinx were the heads and shoulders of men running one of',\n 'these emerged in a pathway leading straight to the little lawn upon',\n 'which i stood with my machine he was a slight creature perhaps',\n 'four feet high clad in a purple tunic girdled at the waist with a',\n 'leather belt sandals or buskins i could not clearly distinguish',\n 'which were on his feet his legs were bare to the knees and his',\n 'head was bare noticing that i noticed for the first time how warm',\n 'the air was',\n '',\n 'he struck me as being a very beautiful and graceful creature but',\n 'indescribably frail his flushed face reminded me of the more',\n 'beautiful kind of consumptive that hectic beauty of which we used',\n 'to hear so much at the sight of him i suddenly regained confidence',\n 'i took my hands from the machine',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n '',\n 'iv',\n '',\n '',\n 'in another moment we were standing face to face i and this fragile',\n 'thing out of futurity he came straight up to me and laughed into my',\n 'eyes the absence from his bearing of any sign of fear struck me at',\n 'once then he turned to the two others who were following him and',\n 'spoke to them in a strange and very sweet and liquid tongue',\n '',\n 'there were others coming and presently a little group of perhaps',\n 'eight or ten of these exquisite creatures were about me one of them',\n 'addressed me it came into my head oddly enough that my voice was',\n 'too harsh and deep for them so i shook my head and pointing to my',\n 'ears shook it again he came a step forward hesitated and then',\n 'touched my hand then i felt other soft little tentacles upon my',\n 'back and shoulders they wanted to make sure i was real there was',\n 'nothing in this at all alarming indeed there was something in',\n 'these pretty little people that inspired confidence a graceful',\n 'gentleness a certain childlike ease and besides they looked so',\n 'frail that i could fancy myself flinging the whole dozen of them',\n 'about like nine pins but i made a sudden motion to warn them when i',\n 'saw their little pink hands feeling at the time machine happily',\n 'then when it was not too late i thought of a danger i had hitherto',\n 'forgotten and reaching over the bars of the machine i unscrewed the',\n 'little levers that would set it in motion and put these in my',\n 'pocket then i turned again to see what i could do in the way of',\n 'communication',\n '',\n 'and then looking more nearly into their features i saw some',\n 'further peculiarities in their dresden china type of prettiness',\n 'their hair which was uniformly curly came to a sharp end at the',\n 'neck and cheek there was not the faintest suggestion of it on the',\n 'face and their ears were singularly minute the mouths were small',\n 'with bright red rather thin lips and the little chins ran to a',\n 'point the eyes were large and mild and this may seem egotism on',\n 'my part i fancied even that there was a certain lack of the',\n 'interest i might have expected in them',\n '',\n 'as they made no effort to communicate with me but simply stood',\n 'round me smiling and speaking in soft cooing notes to each other i',\n 'began the conversation i pointed to the time machine and to myself',\n 'then hesitating for a moment how to express time i pointed to the',\n 'sun at once a quaintly pretty little figure in chequered purple and',\n 'white followed my gesture and then astonished me by imitating the',\n 'sound of thunder',\n '',\n 'for a moment i was staggered though the import of his gesture was',\n 'plain enough the question had come into my mind abruptly were',\n 'these creatures fools you may hardly understand how it took me',\n 'you see i had always anticipated that the people of the year eight',\n 'hundred and two thousand odd would be incredibly in front of us in',\n 'knowledge art everything then one of them suddenly asked me a',\n 'question that showed him to be on the intellectual level of one of',\n 'our five year old children asked me in fact if i had come from',\n 'the sun in a thunderstorm it let loose the judgment i had suspended',\n 'upon their clothes their frail light limbs and fragile features',\n 'a flow of disappointment rushed across my mind for a moment i felt',\n 'that i had built the time machine in vain',\n '',\n 'i nodded pointed to the sun and gave them such a vivid rendering',\n 'of a thunderclap as startled them they all withdrew a pace or so',\n 'and bowed then came one laughing towards me carrying a chain of',\n 'beautiful flowers altogether new to me and put it about my neck',\n 'the idea was received with melodious applause and presently they',\n 'were all running to and fro for flowers and laughingly flinging',\n 'them upon me until i was almost smothered with blossom you who',\n 'have never seen the like can scarcely imagine what delicate and',\n 'wonderful flowers countless years of culture had created then',\n 'someone suggested that their plaything should be exhibited in the',\n 'nearest building and so i was led past the sphinx of white marble',\n 'which had seemed to watch me all the while with a smile at my',\n 'astonishment towards a vast grey edifice of fretted stone as i',\n 'went with them the memory of my confident anticipations of a',\n 'profoundly grave and intellectual posterity came with irresistible',\n 'merriment to my mind',\n '',\n 'the building had a huge entry and was altogether of colossal',\n 'dimensions i was naturally most occupied with the growing crowd of',\n 'little people and with the big open portals that yawned before me',\n 'shadowy and mysterious my general impression of the world i saw',\n 'over their heads was a tangled waste of beautiful bushes and',\n 'flowers a long neglected and yet weedless garden i saw a number',\n 'of tall spikes of strange white flowers measuring a foot perhaps',\n 'across the spread of the waxen petals they grew scattered as if',\n 'wild among the variegated shrubs but as i say i did not examine',\n 'them closely at this time the time machine was left deserted on the',\n 'turf among the rhododendrons',\n '',\n 'the arch of the doorway was richly carved but naturally i did',\n 'not observe the carving very narrowly though i fancied i saw',\n 'suggestions of old phoenician decorations as i passed through and',\n 'it struck me that they were very badly broken and weather worn',\n 'several more brightly clad people met me in the doorway and so we',\n 'entered i dressed in dingy nineteenth century garments looking',\n 'grotesque enough garlanded with flowers and surrounded by an',\n 'eddying mass of bright soft colored robes and shining white limbs',\n 'in a melodious whirl of laughter and laughing speech',\n '',\n 'the big doorway opened into a proportionately great hall hung with',\n 'brown the roof was in shadow and the windows partially glazed',\n 'with coloured glass and partially unglazed admitted a tempered',\n 'light the floor was made up of huge blocks of some very hard white',\n 'metal not plates nor slabs blocks and it was so much worn as i',\n 'judged by the going to and fro of past generations as to be deeply',\n 'channelled along the more frequented ways transverse to the length',\n 'were innumerable tables made of slabs of polished stone raised',\n 'perhaps a foot from the floor and upon these were heaps of fruits',\n 'some i recognized as a kind of hypertrophied raspberry and orange',\n 'but for the most part they were strange',\n '',\n 'between the tables was scattered a great number of cushions',\n 'upon these my conductors seated themselves signing for me to do',\n 'likewise with a pretty absence of ceremony they began to eat the',\n 'fruit with their hands flinging peel and stalks and so forth into',\n 'the round openings in the sides of the tables i was not loath to',\n 'follow their example for i felt thirsty and hungry as i did so i',\n 'surveyed the hall at my leisure',\n '',\n 'and perhaps the thing that struck me most was its dilapidated look',\n 'the stained glass windows which displayed only a geometrical',\n 'pattern were broken in many places and the curtains that hung',\n 'across the lower end were thick with dust and it caught my eye that',\n 'the corner of the marble table near me was fractured nevertheless',\n 'the general effect was extremely rich and picturesque there were',\n 'perhaps a couple of hundred people dining in the hall and most of',\n 'them seated as near to me as they could come were watching me with',\n 'interest their little eyes shining over the fruit they were eating',\n 'all were clad in the same soft and yet strong silky material',\n '',\n 'fruit by the by was all their diet these people of the remote',\n 'future were strict vegetarians and while i was with them in spite',\n 'of some carnal cravings i had to be frugivorous also indeed i',\n 'found afterwards that horses cattle sheep dogs had followed the',\n 'ichthyosaurus into extinction but the fruits were very delightful',\n 'one in particular that seemed to be in season all the time i was',\n 'there a floury thing in a three sided husk was especially good',\n 'and i made it my staple at first i was puzzled by all these strange',\n 'fruits and by the strange flowers i saw but later i began to',\n 'perceive their import',\n '',\n 'however i am telling you of my fruit dinner in the distant future',\n 'now so soon as my appetite was a little checked i determined to',\n 'make a resolute attempt to learn the speech of these new men of',\n 'mine clearly that was the next thing to do the fruits seemed a',\n 'convenient thing to begin upon and holding one of these up i began',\n 'a series of interrogative sounds and gestures i had some',\n 'considerable difficulty in conveying my meaning at first my efforts',\n 'met with a stare of surprise or inextinguishable laughter but',\n 'presently a fair haired little creature seemed to grasp my intention',\n 'and repeated a name they had to chatter and explain the business',\n 'at great length to each other and my first attempts to make the',\n 'exquisite little sounds of their language caused an immense amount',\n 'of amusement however i felt like a schoolmaster amidst children',\n 'and persisted and presently i had a score of noun substantives at',\n 'least at my command and then i got to demonstrative pronouns and',\n 'even the verb to eat but it was slow work and the little people',\n 'soon tired and wanted to get away from my interrogations so i',\n 'determined rather of necessity to let them give their lessons in',\n 'little doses when they felt inclined and very little doses i found',\n 'they were before long for i never met people more indolent or more',\n 'easily fatigued',\n '',\n 'a queer thing i soon discovered about my little hosts and that was',\n 'their lack of interest they would come to me with eager cries of',\n 'astonishment like children but like children they would soon stop',\n 'examining me and wander away after some other toy the dinner and my',\n 'conversational beginnings ended i noted for the first time that',\n 'almost all those who had surrounded me at first were gone it is',\n 'odd too how speedily i came to disregard these little people i',\n 'went out through the portal into the sunlit world again as soon as',\n 'my hunger was satisfied i was continually meeting more of these men',\n 'of the future who would follow me a little distance chatter and',\n 'laugh about me and having smiled and gesticulated in a friendly',\n 'way leave me again to my own devices',\n '',\n 'the calm of evening was upon the world as i emerged from the great',\n 'hall and the scene was lit by the warm glow of the setting sun',\n 'at first things were very confusing everything was so entirely',\n 'different from the world i had known even the flowers the big',\n 'building i had left was situated on the slope of a broad river',\n 'valley but the thames had shifted perhaps a mile from its present',\n 'position i resolved to mount to the summit of a crest perhaps a',\n 'mile and a half away from which i could get a wider view of this',\n 'our planet in the year eight hundred and two thousand seven hundred',\n 'and one a d for that i should explain was the date the little',\n 'dials of my machine recorded',\n '',\n 'as i walked i was watching for every impression that could possibly',\n 'help to explain the condition of ruinous splendour in which i',\n 'found the world for ruinous it was a little way up the hill for',\n 'instance was a great heap of granite bound together by masses of',\n 'aluminium a vast labyrinth of precipitous walls and crumpled',\n 'heaps amidst which were thick heaps of very beautiful pagoda like',\n 'plants nettles possibly but wonderfully tinted with brown about',\n 'the leaves and incapable of stinging it was evidently the derelict',\n 'remains of some vast structure to what end built i could not',\n 'determine it was here that i was destined at a later date to have',\n 'a very strange experience the first intimation of a still stranger',\n 'discovery but of that i will speak in its proper place',\n '',\n 'looking round with a sudden thought from a terrace on which i',\n 'rested for a while i realized that there were no small houses to be',\n 'seen apparently the single
